This work proposes 3D forward modeling of the Slingram Method using Fortran language. The approach is based on the Finite Element Method of edges, which is suitable for accurately representing electromagnetic fields in complex geometries and media with varying physical properties. The main objective is to analyze the behavior of the magnetic field generated by vertical and horizontal magnetic dipoles in models with electrical conductivity contrasts. The code computes the primary fields through Hankel integrals using digital filters, while the secondary field is obtained by solving a linear system via LU decomposition with the PARDISO solver. To reduce computational time, the primary field generation step was parallelized using the MPI library, allowing efficient task distribution for processes. The results demonstrate the potential of the tool for future applications in mineral exploration and geophysical monitoring.
